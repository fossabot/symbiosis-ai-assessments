# [OUTDATED] Symbiosis AI Assessments

This repository contains the decompiled source code for the Symbiosis AI Assessments software (2021). The necessary changes have been made to bypass the cheat check. To switch Windows, use the patched `DiableWinKey-WinFormsApp.exe` and `DiableWinKey-WinFormsApp-DisableRestrictions.exe` provided in the Releases.

## Installation Instructions

You can install this software inside VMWare and then perform all other actions outside. There is no check for VM.
